# Giana Sisters
## "The lost Levels" on C64

Back in 1989 two german programmers **Sandy** and **Prof. Knibble** hacked the C64 game "The Great Giana Sisters".

They programmed a [Giana Sisters Construction Kit](http://www.c64-wiki.de/index.php/Das_Gianna-Sisters_Construction-Kit) which made possible to build custom levels. Unfortunately they could not officially release the software due to copyright and legal issues. Until today there is missing a working "level packager" who could build a working game of the contrsuction kit generated levels. 

The following "Giana Sisters" clones exists which are build by Sandy or Prof. Knibble with the construction kit:

  * Gittys Dreams (I & II)
  * Gittys News & Gittys News +
  * Knibble Girls (I & II)
  * Frankys Horror Trip

### Motivation

Unfortunately I couldn't find any working image of the "Giana Sisters Construction Kit" on the internet. Also some "Giana Sisters" clones are not available. So I transfered some of my old C64 disks to the PC these days.  

### Content

All recovered games can be found in `.d64` images in the corresponding folders.

### Tested

The images are tested with VICE and Emu64 and seems to work fine.

### Todo

"The Power Sisters" couldn't be recovered from disc; so feel free to contribute if you can find this or any other unlisted clone :)

### Disclaimer and License

I'm not involved in any of these projects neither I own any copyrights for this software. Owners retain copyright to their respective works (Time Warp Productions, Rainbow Arts, Armin Gessert, Sandy, Prof. Knibble). The disk images are contributed with no commercial intention. I just share the content of these over 15 years old discs to keep a piece of C64 sofware history.
