# Giana Sisters
## "The lost Levels" on C64

Back in 1989 the two german programmers Sandy and Prof. Knibble hacked the Rainbow Arts C64 release "Giana Sisters".

They programmed a (Giana Sisters Construction Kit)[http://www.c64-wiki.de/index.php/Das_Gianna-Sisters_Construction-Kit] which enabled the user to build custom levels of the "Giana Sisters" game. Unfortunately they could not officially release the software due to copyright and legal issues.

Additionaly there exists these "Giana Sisters" clones which are build with the construction kit:

  * Gittys Dreams (I & II)
  * Gittys News & Gittys News +
  * Knibble Girls (I & II)
  * Frankys Horror Trip

### Motivation

Unfortunately I couldn't find any working image of the "Giana Sisters Construction Kit" on the internet. Also some "Giana Sisters" clones are not available. So I transfered some of my old C64 disks to the PC these days.  

### Content

All recovered games can be found in `.d64` images in the corresponding folders.

### Tested

The images are tested with VICE and Emu64 and seems to work fine.

### Todo

Some "Giana Sisters" clones are still missing. For instance "The Power Sisters" couldn't be recovered from disc; so feel free to contribute if you can find any other clones :)

### Disclaimer and License

I'm not involved in any of these projects neither I own any copyrights for this software. The software is contributed with none commercial background. I just share the content of these over 15 years old discs to keep a piece of C64 sofware history.
